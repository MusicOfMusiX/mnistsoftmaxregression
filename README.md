# Introduction
Part of my ML learning adventure!. Trains on the MNIST handwriting database and (somewhat) manages to be successful after lots of iterations!

Does NOT involve MLPs GAs and all of those complex stuff; just a pure, 1-layer gradient descent-optimised regression model.

Eigen was used for matrix/vector templates and arithmetic. Included in project.

Expected accuracy on test data is around 86% @ 4000 epochs, learning rate=0.005.

Experiment with hyperparameters!

# NOTE
The actual development does not happen on this GitHub repository, but on Microsoft Azure DevOps. This exists solely for public sharing purposes.


# Getting Started
This project is was developed on Windows 10 Build 1803, Visual Studio Community 2017 15.6.6 Platform v141.

# Build and Test
Just open in VS, then hit Build & Run.. I guess..?
