# Introduction
This linear regression model trains on the MNIST handwriting database and (somewhat) manages to be successful after lots of iterations. Highly inefficient.
Does NOT involve MLPs GAs and all of those complex stuff; just a pure, 1-layer gradient descent-optimised regression model.
Eigen was used for matrix/vector templates and arithmetic. Included in project.
Expected accuracy on test data is around 86% @ 4000 epochs, learning rate=0.005.
